# The Project

Firstly, **CSS Components, is a PURE CSS library for front-end development.**

The reason this project started was it developer (yeah, me) being tired of seeing how websites are unnecessarily heavyweight and with slow loading due the use of Javacript and JS libraries on their apperence - wich leads to poor performance and bad programming pratices.

Thinking on the problem of excessive JS use and the lack of several (normally most) useful things in existing pure CSS libraries that do exist in JS powered ones, i've got to one simple conclusion:
*maybe I sould make my own library, using only CSS*.
And ... why not do it?

Initially, it would be a simple copy of major front-end libraries and frameworks, remade with only CSS. But after some redesigns and two years learning more of web programming with pratice, I've decided to go back at the begining and redo the project with the following focuses:

1. **Simplicity**:
It must be easy to use and at the same time make developers job easier;
2. **Performance**:
It must be lightweight and use the miniimum ammount of code needed;
3. **Accessibility**:
It should help to make the web more accessible to everyone;
4. **Standardization**:
It should help to make the websites structure close to common standarts (wich helps with SEO);
5. **Visual**:
Of couse, the library must provide a good visual to sites who use it.

Given that big objetives, the project has 3 long term goals:

1. Be a really useful library to front-end development
2. Implement all accessibility (ARIA) rules and standarts
3. Implement all schema.org standart types

Of couse that's very, very hard to do. So any help is very welcome. ;)
